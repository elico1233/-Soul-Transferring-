## Project Introduction 

#### Exhibition theme: Second Life
#### Title : Soul Transferring

Soul defines the mental abilities of human being which is include of consciousness, memory, emotion, personality, etc. So I think that it will get a lot of benefits if human's soul is able to transfer to a non-biological object.


### Objectives of Project:
1) Let people understanding the amazing of human, create a visualization of "Soul Transferring" that our soul can be transferred by the path of media technology.

2) Feeling back to original form of human, without soul without body, so this project will let human remember back to the beginning, to know what we are.

### Target Users : 

The Target users of this project is stipulated the university/college students and profesional people because there will have different thinking and meaning to the people of different age and different working positions.

### Project Argument :

The project argument of this project is soul is able to transfer to technology item (ex:computer, smart phone,robot, etc.).

### Project Statement :

Transfer or copy the emotion, and personality of a human to a non- biological object by using the media technology.

## Draft Sketches

#### First Skectes

1. Playing an immersive projection in the room.
2. Using camera to capture the movement of user and playing it in the Virtual Reality.
3. Using technology device to read the emotion of human and show their emotion through the visual.

#### Second Skectes

#### Human Head Transplanting 
It is a surgery about Transplant the human's head of receiver to the human's body of provider, which is proposed by Dr. Sergio Canavero – an Italian Neurosurgeon in 2013. He planned to make this surgery in 2017 with china researchers leader Xiaoping Ren. XiaoPing ren have carried out a lot of head transplant experiments on a mice.

##### Steps of human head transplanting

Reference : http://www.sohu.com/a/205653923_115479 
 
 The steps of human head transplanting : 
1.	Find a suitable body provider and ready of the blood supply.
2.	Freeze the body receiver at 12 degrees.
3.	Separate the head of body receiver and body provider and exchange.
4.	Use medical liquid to wash the combine area.
5.	Use needle to combine the spinal cord，esophagus, nerves, muscle and skin.
* The operation of head separate and exchange cannot more than 1 hour.

#### Mind Uploading
The transfer from its original biological brain to an artificial computational substrate, called Whole brain emulation (WBE).  It still exist a lot of issues in this program, which is the path, speed, and etc.

400 speakers, 10 audio tracks, each with multiple recordings; wires, lights

The artist has collected the mysterious case from the whole world and  transmits a voice telling a story. She are sharing the message through the speaker with sound. She hanging all the speakers in a space, users is able to walk around and enjoying the installation.

#### Title : LINK

Cardboard boxes, Projection Mapping

Link is an interactive installation where people can record their stories into a cityscape of cardboard boxes. It is a playful space to keep and shared the stories.

Through the case studies, I have leanning the concept of space and human interaction.

## Installation Planning


### Plan A
#### Plan A_Floor Plan 

![picture8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34241336/36492529-52afb4bc-1768-11e8-888d-a10a0efda092.jpg) ![sketch-01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34241336/36492328-dee34dfa-1767-11e8-8d4b-2b9e6e056238.jpg)

1. Before having interaction with installation, the box just show the "glitch" effect.
2. User is able to using their mobile to scan with QR code that I provided on the wall.
3. User have to answer 3 questions after scanning QR code.
4. After submit the answer, it will show a message that announed " Your soul have been transffered into the gadget."
5. User is able to find their own "soul" through the film that projected on the box.

#### Plan A_Interaction Flow 
The installation is projected from back and mapped on the gadgets shape of cardboards. Before that, it need to enter the information with using mobile. It will translate the information into 2D animation and show it on the particular area through projection. 

#### Plan A_Software
- Xampp – For users to enter the information and send to database
- Unity – Convert the database to media (GIF)
- Resolume – Projection Mapping

#### Plan A_Equipment & Budget
1) Projector x 1 - Rent
2) White Cardboards x 15 - RM95
3) Computer x 1 - Own

#### Plan A_Content
The information that user is able to answer:
-Name :
-Emotion :
a) Joy
b) Suprise
c) Fear
d) Disgust
e) Anger
f) Sadness
- Personality : 
a) Do it now! - Dominant
b) Have fun doing it. - Influential

- Resolume – Using for projection mapping.

#### Plan B_Equipment & Budget
1) Motion Sensor x 15 - RM61.5
2) Arduino x 3 - 1 own, 2 for RM80
3) Computer x 1 - Own
4) Cardboards x 15 - RM95
5) Projector x 1 - Rent

#### Plan C_Interaction Flow
The installation is collecting the information from user and translate it to image which will show on the monitor screen when user get into the room and wearing the cap. Each monitor screen will show each image.

#### Plan C_Software
- Xampp - For users to enter the information and send to database.
- Arduino.ide – Receiver the signal from motion sensor
