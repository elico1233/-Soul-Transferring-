All of the experiment about soul is still unidentified in this era. There is a experiment about weight of soul which is conducted by Dr.Duncan MacDougll. He found that human will lost some weight when they pass away. But same experiment to animal, there is no weight losing, so he proposed that only human have soul.

Cardboard boxes, Projection Mapping

Link is an interactive installation where people can record their stories into a cityscape of cardboard boxes. It is a playful space to keep and shared the stories.

Through the case studies, I have leanning the concept of space and human interaction.

## Installation Planning

### Floor Plan

1. Before having interaction with installation, the box just show the "glitch" effect.
2. User is able to using their mobile to scan with QR code that I provided on the wall.
3. User have to answer 3 questions after scanning QR code.
4. After submit the answer, it will show a message that announed " Your soul have been transffered into the gadget."
5. User is able to find their own "soul" through the film that projected on the box.

### Interaction Flow 
The installation is projected from back and mapped on the gadgets shape of cardboards. Before that, it need to enter the information with using mobile. It will translate the information into 2D animation and show it on the particular area through projection.
